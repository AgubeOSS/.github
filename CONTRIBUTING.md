# Contributing to AvailaOSS
We want to make contributing to our project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Contribution recogniton

We use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification) specification to handle recognitions.

## Conventional commits

Our repositories follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification. Releasing to GitHub and NPM is done with the support of [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

Pull requests should have a title that follows the specification, otherwise, merging is blocked. If you are not familiar with the specification simply ask maintainers to modify. You can also use this cheatsheet if you want:

- `fix: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a bug fix and PATCH release must be triggered.
- `feat: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a feature and MINOR release must be triggered.
- `docs: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to the documentation and there is no need to trigger release.
- `chore: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to cleanup in the project and there is no need to trigger release.
- `test: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to tests and there is no need to trigger release.
- `refactor: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to refactoring and there is no need to trigger release.

What about MAJOR release? just add `!` to the prefix, like `fix!: ` or `refactor!: `

Prefix that follows specification is not enough though. Remember that the title must be clear and descriptive with usage of [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).

Happy contributing ❤️
